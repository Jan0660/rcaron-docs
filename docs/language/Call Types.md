# Call Types

More comprehensible terminology is coming sometime in the future...

## Call-like call

It can also be called a keyword call. A call-like call goes like:

```rcaron
somethingToCall($arg1, namedParameter: $arg2)
```

## Keyword plain call

Not confusing, right? A keyword plain call goes like:

```rcaron
somethingToCall $arg1 -namedParameter $arg2
```
