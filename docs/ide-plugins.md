# IDE Plugins

Currently RCaron has only a VSCode plugin, but more will come in the future.

## VSCode

You can find it on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Jan0660.rcaron).

Then head to [here](https://github.com/Jan0660/rcaron-vscode#language-server) for info on how to get the language server.
