# IDE Plugins

Currently RCaron has only a VSCode plugin, but more will come in the future.

## VSCode

You currently have to build it yourself from [the repo](https://github.com/Jan0660/rcaron-vscode).

After installing it you have to set the path to the Language Server in the settings, which you also have to build yourself from the `RCaron.LanguageServer` project in [the RCaron repository](https://github.com/Jan0660/RCaron).
